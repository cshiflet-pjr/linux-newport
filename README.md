Popcorn Linux for Distributed Thread Execution
----------------------------------------------

* Allow applications to run on multiple machines in a distributed and transparent way.

* If you want to try popcorn-kernel, please go to the [wiki page](https://github.com/ssrg-vt/popcorn-kernel/wiki) first. That wiki page should contain all the useful precedures for setting up popcorn with VMs.

* Popcorn Linux kernel is currently under development, you might get a very large git repo if you try to clone it. Instead, we provide a [release version](https://github.com/ssrg-vt/popcorn-kernel/releases/tag/linux-4.4.137) and strongly suggest you download the source code from the [release](https://github.com/ssrg-vt/popcorn-kernel/releases/tag/linux-4.4.137).
